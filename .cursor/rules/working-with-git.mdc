# Git Standards & Workflow

When the user asks you to push code, commit changes, or prepare a release, you MUST follow these rules.

## 1. Conventional Commits

Always compose commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

**Format:**
```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries (e.g., ci, deno.json)

**Examples:**
- `feat(logger): add async context support`
- `fix(utils): resolve null pointer exception`
- `chore(ci): update github actions configuration`

## 2. Release Tagging Strategy

This monorepo uses **independent versioning** for each package. When creating tags for releases, you MUST use the scoped tagging convention:

```text
<package-name>/v<version>
```

**Examples:**
- `logger/v1.0.0`
- `utils/v2.1.0`

**NEVER** use a bare version tag (like `v1.0.0`) as it is ambiguous in a monorepo.

## 3. Pushing Code

When asked to push:
1.  Verify linting and tests pass (`deno task test`).
2.  Stage relevant files.
3.  Generate a Conventional Commit message.
4.  If it is a release, remind the user about the tagging convention or generate the tag command if requested.
